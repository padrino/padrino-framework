Many people love the simplicity and expressiveness of Sinatra but quickly find themselves missing a great deal of
functionality provided by other web frameworks such as Rails when building non-trivial applications.


Sinatra acts as a thin layer on top of Rack itself and the "micro"-framework is kept light introducing complexities only
when required by the particular application. Our goal with Padrino is to stay true to the core principles of Sinatra
including a focus on simplicity and modularity.


Starting from this assumption, we have developed a different approach to a web development framework. We expand on
Sinatra through the addition of standard libraries including helpers, components, and other functionality that are
needed in a framework suitable for arbitrarily complex web applications.
