Building on our experience in developing web applications, we designed a framework that meets all the requirements for
creating a top notch web application in a *clean*, *concise* and *simple environment*, with minimal *deadline* delays.


We provide you with the following out of the box:

    |>. **Agnostic:** | Full support for many popular testing, templating,
    mocking, and database libraries.
    |
    |>. **Generators:** | Create Padrino applications, models, controllers,
    admin.
    |
    |>. **Mountable:** | Unlike other ruby frameworks, principally designed
    for mounting multiple apps.
    |
    |>. **Routing:** | Full url named routes, named params, respond_to
    support, before/after filter support.
    |
    |>. **Helpers:** | Different helpers for generating tags, forms, links,
    images, and more.
    |
    |>. **Mailer:** | Fast and simple support for delivering emails.
    |
    |>. **Admin:** | Built-in admin interface (akin to Django) with
    authentication.
    |
    |>. **Logging:** | Provides a unified logger that can interact with
    your ORM or any library of your choice.
    |
    |>. **Reloading:** | Automatically reloads server code during
    development.
    |
    |>. **Localization:** | Full support for I18n localization.
