<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> comes preloaded with
flexible code generators powered in part by the excellent Thor gem
(incidentally also used in the Rails 3 generators). These generators are
intended to allow for easy code generation both in creating new
applications and building on existing ones. The generators have been built
to be as library agnostic as possible, supporting a myriad of test
frameworks, js libraries, mocking libraries, etc.
</p>
<p>
See the guide for <a
href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>
for a more in-depth look at the system.
</p>
<h3>Project Generator</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> provides generator support
for quickly creating new <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a>
applications. This provides many benefits such as constructing the
recommended <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application
structure, auto-generating a Gemfile listing all starting dependencies and
guidelines provided within the generated files to help orient a new user to
using <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a>.
</p>
<p>
One important feature of the generators is that they were built from the
ground up to support a wide variety of tools, libraries and gems for use
within your padrino application.
</p>
<p>
The simplest possible command to generate a base application would be:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen project demo_project
</pre>
<p>
This would construct a <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a>
application DemoApp (which extends from <a
href="../../classes/Padrino/Application.html">Padrino::Application</a>)
inside the folder &#8216;demo_project&#8217; at our current path. Inside
the application there would be configuration and setup performed for the
default components.
</p>
<p>
You can define specific components to be used:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen project demo_project -t rspec -r haml -m rr -s jquery -d datamapper
</pre>
<p>
You can also instruct the generator to skip a certain component to avoid
using one at all (or to use your own):
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen project demo_project --test none --renderer none
</pre>
<p>
The available components and their default options are listed below:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">test:</td><td>rspec (default), bacon, shoulda, cucumber, testspec, riot

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">renderer:</td><td>haml (default), erb, erubis, liquid

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">stylesheet:</td><td>sass (default), less, compass

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">mock:</td><td>none (default), mocha, rr

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">script:</td><td>none (default), jquery, prototype, mootools, rightjs, extcore, dojo

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">orm:</td><td>none (default), datamapper, mongomapper, mongoid, activerecord, sequel,
couchrest

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition, you can generate projects based on existing templates:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen project demo_project --template sampleblog
</pre>
<p>
To learn more about the project generator, check out the guide to <a
href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>.
</p>
<h3>Plugin System</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> provides support for
plugins to be executed within your application. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen plugin hoptoad
</pre>
<p>
would install the hoptoad middleware into your application automatically.
</p>
<p>
To learn more about the plugin system, check out the guide to <a
href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>.
</p>
<h3>Sub App Generator</h3>
<p>
Unlike other ruby frameworks <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> is principally designed for
mounting multiple apps at the same time.
</p>
<p>
First you need to create a project
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen project demo_project
  $ cd demo_project
</pre>
<p>
Now you are in demo_project and you can create your apps:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen app one
  $ padrino-gen app two
</pre>
<p>
By default these apps are mounted under:
</p>
<pre>
  * /one
  * /two
</pre>
<p>
but you can edit config/apps.rb and change it.
</p>
<p>

href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>.
</p>
<h3>Model Generator</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> provides generator support
for quickly creating new models within your <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application. Note that the
models (and migrations) generated are specifically tailored towards the ORM
component and testing framework chosen during application generation.
</p>
<p>
Very important to note that model generators are intended primarily to work
within applications created through the <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application generator and
that follow <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> conventions.
Using model generators within an existing application not generated by <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> will likely not work as
expected.
</p>
<p>
Using the model generator is as simple as:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen model User
</pre>
<p>
You can also specify desired fields to be contained within your User model:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen model User name:string age:integer email:string
</pre>
<p>
To learn more about the model generator, check out the guide to <a
href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>.
</p>
<h3>Migration Generator</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> provides generator for
quickly generating new migrations to change or manipulate the database
schema. These migrations generated will be tailored towards the ORM chosen
when generating the application.
</p>
<p>
Very important to note that migration generators are intended primarily to
work within applications created through the <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application generator and
that follow <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> conventions.
Using migration generators within an existing application not generated by
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> will likely not work as
expected.
</p>
<p>
Using the migration generator is as simple as:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen migration AddFieldsToUsers
  $ padrino-gen migration RemoveFieldsFromUsers
</pre>
<p>
To learn more about the migration generator, check out the guide to <a
href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>.
</p>
<h3>Controller Generator</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> provides generator support
for quickly creating new controllers within your <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application. Note that the
controller tests are generated specifically tailored towards the testing
framework chosen during application generation.
</p>
<p>
Very important to note that controller generators are intended primarily to
work within applications created through the <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application generator and
that follow <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> conventions.
</p>
<p>
Using the controller generator is as simple as:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen controller Admin
</pre>
<p>
You can also specify desired actions to be added to your controller:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen controller Admin get:index get:new post:create
</pre>
<p>
To learn more about the controller generator, check out the guide to <a
href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators">Padrino Generators</a>.
</p>
<h3>Mailer Generator</h3>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> provides generator support
for quickly creating new mailers within your <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application. Very important
to note that mailer generators are intended primarily to work within
applications created through the <a
href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> application generator and
that follow <a href="../../classes/Padrino.html">Padrino</a> conventions.
</p>
<p>
Using the mailer generator is as simple as:
</p>
<pre>
  $ padrino-gen mailer UserNotifier
</pre>
<p>
