- Why Fikus?


I was in need of a very simple content management system. I wanted to quickly author somewhat static pages together for
the web, but I didn’t want to deal with deploying the site, uploading files, or dealing with fitting my content in
templates. That ruled out a lot of existing content management systems that did too much for what I wanted.


I also wanted a chance to play with the Padrino framework, which is a MVC architecture framework built on top of
Sinatra.


Initially I looked at a CMS like Nesta but decided I wanted my pages (or documents) stored in a document database and a
simple admin interface for editing them. I liked the idea of using Markdown, so I decided to create something that fit
my needs.


Fikus was born.


## What does Fikus mean?

Think of it as a tree, but I was listening to Phish when starting the project. That's all it is.
