p. Padrino has really shaped up to be an excellent framework and a pleasure to develop in on top of Sinatra.
The important thing is that Padrino tries to take everything that developers love about Sinatra and enhance
these features to make them even better. Padrino also provides critical functionality missing from Sinatra
such as baked-in localization, dead simple mail delivery and form helpers.

p. To learn more about Padrino and to start using it for your web development, check out the "Guides
Section":/guides for a detailed reference on Padrino's major components. In addition, checkout the "Padrino
RDoc":/api for a more complete look at the framework. Specifically, you might want to start with the "Blog
Tutorial":/guides/blog-tutorial which walks through the step by step development of building a basic blog
using Padrino.
