:title: Padrino 0.9.14 - Important Hotfixes
---
There are three major things fixed in this version. The biggest fix which has been causing a number of issues
is the failure of Padrino to properly camelize application names. This causes a number of uninitialized
constant failures for certain application names. This version re-factors the mounter so that this error no
longer occurs and the correct application class is found in those failing cases. This should fix a number of
associated issues related to failing migrations and scripts.

The next fix is we fixed a warning on mongo_mapper because mongo_mapper now requires bson_ext instead of
mongo_ext. The generator has been changed to address this. We also fixed other minor issues that were
affecting our users.

Here is a full list of changes in this version:

* Application generator should create public subfolder
* Refactored application mounter class
* updated mongomapper to use bson_ext
* use entity code instead of copyright symbol
* ensure app generation creates own public folder
* fix padrino g alias
* fixed distance_of_time_in_words helper(Thanks to Yannick Koechlin)

Please download this version as soon as you can to correct these important issue.
