:title: Padrino 0.9.28 - Reloader, Compatibility and Bug Fixes
---
Two very small additions:

* Added an alias to @padrino start@ as @padrino s@ for convenience
"here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/ef47900afffc1ff0743fc3aa723639efd4975d06
* Added an easy way to generate a Rakefile
["here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/81e54b116d54ee791ccd44e7156ee4156f16034c]. This
allows you to stop using @padrino rake@ and use @rake@ directly. Especially useful for Heroku deployed apps!
Simply run @$ padrino rake gen@.

This is a simple bugfix release with these being the major fixes:

* Development reloader hangs during reload fixed
"here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/054c2795600d2ce7e220dd1cef2cbe2755b273d2
* Updated couch_rest models and dependencies
"here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/d6d053965511fb170cf5befc89bbeeefa7cd24e9 and
"here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/a836741cf6017ae955f90d44a743c4a0b226e1d7
* Fixed mongoid and mongomapper deps
"here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/e5cff99646e50b6f44d1bb7b07e63090a688b551 and
["here":https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/ff320862bfbf76ff3c46e70aa519672039ad1604]. Thanks
