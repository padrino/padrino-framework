TODO

* We need to fix the parent Rakefile to easily support publishing each gem (?)
* Add tests for padrino_core gem
* Fix generators and project to import concept-app changes (base_app, etc)
  * Figure out how we want the sinatra-gen to work now
  $ padrino-gen project project_name
  $ cd project_name
  $ padrino-gen app app_name
* Make sure reloader middleware works for urls, models, controllers and all application files
* Implement padrino-core padrino file for tasks (start, stop, test, console)
* Decide what to do about initializers (where do they go single app, multiple apps)
* Figure out where to work in the WardenPlugin
* Finish sinatra-cache gem
* Finish sinatra-admin gem
* Add helpers to helpers gem:
  * ajax helpers (http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/ajax_helper.rb)
* Fix documentation (README, wiki) for each gem (overview in padrino and standalone usage in each subgem)
* Move the mounting process (for multiple apps) to use rack-mount (http://github.com/josh/rack-mount)

COMPLETED

* Moved over all the gems to jeweler with built in rake tasks releases, testing, versioning, etc
* Added gems to their own repos and added them back to test-app as submodules
* Added over existing tests and make them pass for each gem
* Made the sinatra-gen at least have tests pass and fixed errors (still needs a lot of work)
* Added the padrino bin file to padrino-core using Thor to stub out support for the commands (still need to be implemented)
* Added support for test task outside in lib/padrino which runs all tests for all the subgems
