## Preface

Padrino is a ruby framework built upon the Sinatra web library. Sinatra is a DSL for creating simple web applications in Ruby. Padrino was created to make it fun and easy to code more advanced web applications while still adhering to the spirit that makes Sinatra great!

 

## Introduction

Many people love the simplicity and expressiveness of Sinatra but quickly come to miss a great deal of functionality provided by other web frameworks such as Rails when building non-trivial applications.

Our goal with Padrino is to stay true to the core principles of Sinatra while at the same time creating a standard library of tools, helpers and functions that will make Sinatra suitable for increasingly complex applications.
