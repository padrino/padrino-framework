Many people love the simplicity and expressiveness of Sinatra but quickly find themselves missing a great deal of functionality provided by other web frameworks such as Rails when building non-trivial applications.

Sinatra acts as a thin layer on top of Rack itself and the “micro”-framework is kept light introducing complexities only when required by the particular application. Our goal with Padrino is to stay true to the core principles of Sinatra including a focus on simplicity and modularity.

Starting from this assumption, we have developed a different approach to a web development framework. We expand on Sinatra through the addition of standard libraries including helpers, components, and other functionality that are needed in a framework suitable for arbitrarily complex web applications.
