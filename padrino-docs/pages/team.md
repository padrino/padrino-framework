Padrino exists today because of the efforts of these core members as well as the effort of the amazing Padrino community.

Each team member has committed great time and effort towards the creation, documentation and development of this framework. The team consists of programmers from all over the world including the United States and Italy.

Special Thanks also to *Simone Crespi* for helping us in building this website.
