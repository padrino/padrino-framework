title: Introducing Padrino!
---

Our team has been working hard on Padrino for the last few months to get this framework polished enough to be used by a larger group of people. For the most part, Padrino is now quite stable and has been used to develop a number of applications (including this site!).

We recently decided to focus our efforts on generating documentation to easily inform developers of the functionality provided by this framework. This website is our first attempt to make the necessary information about Padrino readily available to all.

Padrino has really shaped up to be an excellent framework and a pleasure to develop in on top of Sinatra. The important thing is that Padrino tries to take everything that developers love about Sinatra and enhance these features to make them even better. Padrino also provides critical functionality missing from Sinatra such as baked-in localization, dead simple mail delivery and form helpers.

To learn more about Padrino and to start using it for your web development, check out the [Guides Section](/guides) for a detailed reference on Padrinoâ€™s major components. In addition, checkout the [Padrino RDoc](/api) for a more complete look at the framework. Specifically, you might want to start with the [Blog Tutorial](/guides/blog-tutorial) which walks through the step by step development of building a basic blog using Padrino.
