[Darío Cravero](https://github.com/dariocravero) has been helping with Padrino and has been [creating useful extensions](https://github.com/dariocravero/declarative_authorization_padrino). Having submitted several pull requests and consistently helping us to keep up with the flow of new issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues) he agreed to join the Padrino core team.

Dario has started several companies and is currently the co-founder of [uxtemple](http://www.uxtemple.com/). We are very excited to welcome him aboard and also to pick up the pace of Padrino development. We know that we have a long way to go with Padrino, but we are committed to making this framework as solid and easy to use as possible. Expect more news soon as we ramp up our efforts on Padrino for the new year!
