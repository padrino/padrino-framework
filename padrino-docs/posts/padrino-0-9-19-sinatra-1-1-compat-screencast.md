title: Padrino 0.9.19 - Sinatra 1.1 compat, Screencast!
---

We happy, after our first birthday (11/11/10), to announce padrino 0.9.19.

We are very, very, near to the version 1.0.

We need to finish only three things:

-   Documentation of padrino-cache
-   Finish [ajax helpers](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/tree/ajax_helpers)
-   Finish [nested forms helpers](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/tree/nested_form_helpers)

If you want to contribute, focus on this three points.

Also, there is a poll on [PeepCode](http://suggestions.peepcode.com/forums/15-general/suggestions/1064769-padrino) so please [VOTE](http://suggestions.peepcode.com/forums/15-general/suggestions/1064769-padrino) for our [Screencast](http://suggestions.peepcode.com/forums/15-general/suggestions/1064769-padrino) !
