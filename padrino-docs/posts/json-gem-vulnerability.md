title: JSON gem vulnerability
---

An vulnerability affecting the `json` gem has been found. A detailed explanation can be found at the [Rails security mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/4_YvCpLzL58) .

This is **not** an isolated Rails issue, as it affects a third-party library. It affects all users of the `json` gem. This gem might be pulled in as a dependency of other libraries in use. You can check whether you application uses the `json` gem by running:

    bundle show

We strongly urge all users of Padrino to upgrade their applications using:

    bundle update json

to at least: 1.7.7, 1.6.8, 1.5.5.

Also, never use `JSON.load`, but `JSON.parse`, except when you really know what you are doing.
