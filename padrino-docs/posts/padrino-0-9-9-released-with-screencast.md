title: Padrino 0.9.9 Released with Screencast
---

Today, our team has also released Padrino 0.9.9 which is the second update following the official “1.0” release of [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) itself! This latest update to Padrino contains many important changes such as fixes to compatibility with 1.8.6, 1.9, and JRuby as well as critical rendering functionality improvements.

Also, in the spirit of making Padrino accessible to many new users, we have finished the [blog tutorial](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/blog-tutorial) which takes the reader through step-by-step building a basic blog within Padrino. This is an excellent way to get familiar with the enhanced features Padrino provides. In addition, our team has developed a [blog tutorial screencast](http://vimeo.com/10522357) which can be [downloaded](http://padrino.s3.amazonaws.com/screencast_1.mov) or [streamed](http://vimeo.com/10522357).

The Padrino team has been working hard on preparing the framework and documentation for wider scale usage. This website now contains a great deal of useful resources such as the many [guides](http://padrinorb.com/guides), [contribution guidelines](http://www.padrinorb.com/pages/contribute), [team information](http://padrinorb.com/team), [release notes](http://padrinorb.com/changes), among much more.

All of us are excited for Padrino to be tested and experimented with by the larger Sinatra community. Padrino is indeed a ‘full-stack’ framework but it never strays away from the Sinatra philosophy to keep things simple and lightweight. In fact, the Padrino functionality has been built to be as modular as possible.

If you do not want to build a full Padrino application, but would like to take advantage of certain enhancements such as the [application helpers](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/application-helpers), [enhanced routing](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/controllers), or the [mail delivery](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/padrino-mailer) be sure to check out how to [utilize Padrino within an existing Sinatra application](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/standalone-usage-in-sinatra).
