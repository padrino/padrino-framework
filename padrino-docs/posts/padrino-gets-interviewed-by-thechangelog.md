title: Padrino Gets Interviewed by thechangelog!
---

[thechangelog](http://thechangelog.com/) is a weekly podcast hosted by [Adam](http://adamstacoviak.com) and [Wynn](http://wynnnetherland.com) that discusses “what’s fresh and new in open source”. Two of the core Padrino team members, Nathan and Arthur, recently had an opportunity to chat on air when Adam and Wynn decided to devote an entire episode to Padrino! The podcast runs for about 32 minutes and includes a nice discussion about Rack, Middleware, Sinatra and Padrino. Read the full blog post to listen to the interview!

You can visit the [Padrino episode](http://thechangelog.com/post/708173099/episode-0-2-7-padrino-ruby-web-framework) page to view the entire show notes with excellent related links and resources mentioned in the discussion.

We would also like to reiterate a few resources here which are particularly valuable for Padrino developers:

-   [Rack Website](http://rack.rubyforge.org) – If you are using Padrino (built on Rack), you should eventually become familiar with the underlying “Rack” architecture. It is easy to understand and really helps give you a better picture of what is involved with a web application behind the scenes.
-   [CodeRack](http://coderack.org) – Rack middleware is an excellent way to add functionality to your project without having to do any implementation work in your application. There is rack middleware to do everything from [displaying a captcha](http://github.com/achiu/rack-recaptcha) to [authenticating users](http://github.com/intridea/omniauth) and even [bundling your assets](http://github.com/juliocesar/rack-bundle)
-   [Presto](http://github.com/pengwynn/presto) – Wynn’s shameless port of Nesta CMS to Padrino powering his own site
-   [Padrino Extensions](http://wiki.github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/extensions) – A starting set of Padrino extensions and recommended libraries for various common requirements

The Padrino team would like to thank [Adam](http://adamstacoviak.com) and [Wynn](http://wynnnetherland.com) very much for this excellent show they put together every week and for having us on to discuss Padrino at length. We know both of them are fans of Padrino and just chatting with them was great fun.
