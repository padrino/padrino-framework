title: Hosting our first Padrino meetup in San Francisco!
---

One of our core Padrino members [DAddYE](https://github.com/DAddYE) has moved to San Francisco recently and has joined as a developer at [Triggit](http://triggit.com). The Padrino core team has always been a very distributed team with each of us living in different places until recently.

Since Davide, Josh and I all live in the city now, we thought it would make sense to [host our first meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Padrino-SF/events/95840992/) in San Francisco.

[Triggit](http://triggit.com) has graciously agreed to let us use their office for the **meetup** and some food for *you*.

Come [join us](http://www.meetup.com/Padrino-SF/events/95840992/) on *Thursday, January 24th at 6:30pm* to learn more about our plans for **Padrino** in the coming year as we continue our long journey to 1.0.

<break>

We will talking about the coming Padrino 0.11 release and we want to share our plans for Padrino 1.0, which aims to be a big step forward for us since will be focused on **multi-threading** with a special focus on JRuby.

There are more cool things like *full modularized templates*, *routes* etcâ€¦ stay tuned for more details.

We are excited about jump starting our development efforts again and would love everyone interested in Sinatra and Padrino to attend.

Please [RSVP to the event](http://www.meetup.com/Padrino-SF/events/95840992/) so we can get a rough sense of the number of people attending. Look forward to seeing you guys there!
