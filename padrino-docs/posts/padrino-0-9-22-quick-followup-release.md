title: Padrino 0.9.22 - Quick Followup Release
---

Even though we just released the latest Padrino (0.9.21) and that was relatively stable (for a pre-stable), an unexpected event happened shortly thereafter. Sinatra released the final version of 1.2.0. This was an awesome release thanks in large part to [Konstantin Haase](https://github.com/rkh). Even though the release has many great things, it also added a new helper method to Sinatra called [uri and aliased as url](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/4248e6dde2df46a5afcdb4b5252ee1066f50906e/lib/sinatra/base.rb#L114-127) .

This of course overlaps with the [padrino url method](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/blob/master/padrino-core/lib/padrino-core/application/routing.rb#L253-274) . This causes incompatibility with Padrino and Sinatra 1.2.0 so a quick fix was in order. At the same time, there were a number of other patches after our last release which we will roll in as well including http fixes and japanese translations. Details are in the full post.

## Locked Padrino to Sinatra 1.1

Padrino will soon be fully compatible with Sinatra 1.2.0. Until then, we locked Padrino to Sinatra \< 1.2.0 in order to guarantee proper functioning in this release.

## Performance Improvements

Padrino is always striving to be faster and to give more throughput. After all a big advantage of Padrino is that it require less memory and resources than other frameworks as well as providing higher requests per second. There has been a recent push to [update our benchmarks](https://github.com/DAddYE/web-frameworks-benchmark/wiki/achiu) to be as correct and relevant as possible. Thanks to judofyr for his help with making the benchmarks more accurate. See [the results](https://github.com/DAddYE/web-frameworks-benchmark/wiki/achiu) or fork us and help improve them.

In that vein we also made to small changes to improve performance:

-   Padrino now subclasses from Sinatra::Base rather than Sinatra::Application. This is faster and doesnâ€™t remove any functionality we require.
-   Padrino now supports the `set :padrino_logging, false` option to stop padrino from logging and improve speed significantly in return.

There will be a stronger performance push soon as we work to keep Padrino as lightweight as possible.

## HTTP Fixes

Patrick Lef has been kind enough to point out multiple failing http specs in our core handling, so we [made](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/8f5d1b5104427482ffd16146fb22e30f5dc6ee60)" a [few](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/25042a6c734bbfb97a893fa898d4c9d8924aa810) [fixes](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/7127017840e8adaee85c345d8fa02655b0fff4f2). Thanks to core Padrino member Florian for putting those all together so quickly!

Major changes were:

-   Set status to 406 on non-provided ACCEPTS
-   Return first provided mime-type on ACCEPT = **/**
-   Assume **/** if no ACCEPT header is given

Being a web server, Padrino desires to fully respect the standard behaviors specified and we are getting closer each release :) If you know of any outstanding bugs please [open an issue](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues).

## Japanese Translations

[udzura](https://github.com/udzura) recently sent us Japanese translations to Padrino. We have really gotten quite a lot of internationalization support for admin and every new language is great to be able to include. Are we missing a localization for your language? Be sure to let us know or [submit a patch](http://www.padrinorb.com/pages/contribute) to help us include that.

## Compatibility fixes

-   Fixes mongoid locking it to correct dependency
-   Fixes password encryption in the account model
-   Fixes mongomapper template in admin
