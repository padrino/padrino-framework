This is Fikus, a simple content management system written in the Ruby programming language.

> Fikus dreamed a dream for me / It cost me nothing it was free / He dreamed of walking in the sand / Of blossoms forming in his hand" / — from Fikus, by Phish

-   Data stored in MongoDB
-   Built-in page caching for performance
-   Ability to specify different layouts per page

### Why Fikus?

I was in need of a very simple content management system. I wanted to quickly author somewhat static pages together for the web, but I didn’t want to deal with deploying the site, uploading files, or dealing with fitting my content in templates. That ruled out a lot of existing content management systems that did too much for what I wanted.

I also wanted a chance to play with the Padrino framework, which is a MVC architecture framework built on top of Sinatra.

Initially I looked at a CMS like Nesta but decided I wanted my pages (or documents) stored in a document database and a simple admin interface for editing them. I liked the idea of using Markdown, so I decided to create something that fit my needs.

Fikus was born.

### What does Fikus mean?

Think of it as a tree, but I was listening to Phish when starting the project. That’s all it is.
