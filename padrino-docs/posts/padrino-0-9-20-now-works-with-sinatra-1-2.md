title: Padrino 0.9.20 - now works with Sinatra 1.2
---

Today, we have released a new version of Padrino 0.9.20 which is fully compatible with Sinatra 1.1.0, 1.1.2 and 1.2a. There have also been a great deal of bug fixes in this release as well for many of the core functions provided by Padrino.

The major things that have been modified in this release are the easier management of middleware, fixing datamapper issues, adds erubis support, fixes to project generation, slim support, and namespaced application support in mounter. A more detailed list of changes is included below.

There are no breaking changes from the previous version. Other than Sinatra 1.1.X and 1.2 support, the following are the major changes in 0.9.20:

## Middleware Management

You can now easily manage middleware in front of the Padrino application stack. To add middleware simply do:

    Padrino.use(Some::Middleware)

You can also clear all middleware with:

    Padrino.clear_middleware!

See [this commit](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/0a9d11a01c51b5c351bb98b310cff55e4b659c1f) for more information about this.

## New Rendering Components

Padrino now supports slim and erubis rendering engines out of the box. To use slim or erubis, just use the generators:

`$ padrino g project example --renderer=slim # or erubis`

This will generate the project to use those templates by default and properly include them in the Gemfile!

## Namespaced Mounter Support

Padrinoâ€™s project mounter now supports namespaced applications properly as follows:

    module ::SomeNamespace
      class AnApp < Padrino::Application; end
    end

    Padrino.mount("some_namespace/an_app").to("/")

See [this commit](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/b7f5bb94d7a4e7264fcc8be5bc0b245f996ee60f) for more details. Thanks mcmire!

There were also a lot of other bugfixes in this release as we try to become more and more stable towards a 1.0 release.

## Next Step

We are already working towards a 0.9.21 release and will likely include more bugfixes, more components, etc. If you run into a problem please do let us know on [Github Issues](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues) or better yet with a [Pull Request](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/pulls) .
